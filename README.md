1. As a customer, I should be able to login into my account, so that I can view my fitness performance.

2. As a new customer,  I should be able to sign up for the app, so that I can use the app.

3. As a customer, I should be able to safely log out from my account, so that I can ensure no one is able to use my account without permission.

4.  As a customer, I should be able to select an exercise, so that I can choose from different exercises that I wish to map for performance.

5. As a customer, I should be able to log the specific details of their exercise (e.g. weight and reps), so that I am able to track increasing weights used and reps for exercise.
